<h1>Hi, I'm <b>Matthew</b>!</h1>

I'm a Junior studying <b>Computer Science</b> and <b>Design</b> at Stanford University. ðŸŒ²
My focus is currently Human-Computer Interaction, but I am still discovering all that CS has to offer!

### Outside of Coding
â€¢ I am the Stanford Class of 2026 President @ [Stanford L.I.F.T.](https://www.instagram.com/stanfordlift/)

â€¢ I am a founder @ [TheCupidProject](https://www.thecupidproject.org), an annual card-giving project delivering to nursing homes every Valentine's Day since 2018. 

â€¢ I play the violin, classical guitar, ukelele (WIP), and piano (WIP).

â€¢ I love to create thingsâ€” art, music, web apps, friendships, etc.

Much like my uke and piano skills, my GitHub is very much a Work In Progress; <br>
nevertheless, I hope you enjoy purusing my projects!
